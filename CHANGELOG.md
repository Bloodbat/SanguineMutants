### Aestus

Based on MI's Tides, it fixes PLL mode, separates it from the clock input; restores switching banks using the clock input when module is using the Sheep firmware; fixes the inverted "Mode" light colors; fixes the broken "High" and "Low" outputs, and, hopefully, fixes a long-standing crash that occurs under specific circumstances.

### Temulenti

Based on the Parasite firmware for MI's Tides: includes every Aestus fix, additionally: restores functionality when using the clock input in Two Bumps or Two Drunks modes; Sheep model can be used.

### Vimina

A polyphonic dual clock divider, multiplier and swinger based on the Twigs firmware for MI's Branches.

## Additions

- Polyphony for Incurvationes, Distortiones and Mutuus, active channels are shown using rows of LEDs around the INT. OSC. button.

- Polyphonic indicator LED lights show the current algorithm for every channel in Incurvationes.

- Polyphonic indicator LED lights show the current mode for every channel in Distortiones and Mutuus.

- Direct or note CV per channel mode selection for Anuli, Distortiones and Mutuus.

- Per channel "Meta-modulation" is always available for Nodi and Contextus: the FM input always does FM.

- Nebulae, Etesia and Fluctus always sum polyphonic input channels, per the voltage standards.

- Ability to select the channel to show in the display for Anuli, Funes, Nodi and Contextus.

- Ability to select the channel to show in Aleae's LEDs.

- Dim LED button's light intensity a little.

- Performance tweaks.

- Disable "LFO" range in Nodi and Contextus.

# 2.4.1

## Changes

---

# 2.4.0

## New Modules

### Fluctus

Based on the Kammerl Beat-Repeat firmware for Clouds.

### Incurvationes

Based on MI's Warps, it has proper knob lights colors and enables access to the Frequency shifter "Easter egg".

### Distortiones

Based on the Parasite firmware for Warps, it no longer crashes when multiple instances are used (and they don't interfere with each other...); it also includes a mode selector similar to the one used for the hardware module.

### Mutuus

Based on the Symbiote firmware for Warps, it includes the improvements in Incurvationes and Distortiones.

### Explorator

Based on MI's Kinks and Links, they are combined in a single module.

The Kinks section is now fully polyphonic. The Links 3:1 section can optionally behave as the hardware module and average the connected voltages. All LEDs now reflect when polyphonic channels are used.

### Marmora

Based on MI's Marbles, it exposes every control and adds missing features like user defined scales; super lock; t and X reset; restores missing light animations and showing polarity in the output port LEDs.

### Anuli

Based on MI's Rings, it restores missing light animations; the "3" polyphony mode... and is completely polyphonic.

### Velamina

My attempt at recreating Veils... the 2020 version. It is polyphonic and saturates outputs beyond 10V.

## Additions
