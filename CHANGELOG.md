# 2.4.0

## New Modules

### Fluctus

Based on the Kammerl Beat-Repeat firmware for Clouds.

### Incurvationes

Based on MI's Warps, it has proper knob lights colors and enables access to the Frequency shifter "Easter egg".

### Distortiones

Based on the Parasite firmware for Warps, it no longer crashes when multiple instances are used (and they don't interfere with each other...); it also includes a mode selector similar to the one used for the hardware module.

### Mutuus

Based on the Symbiote firmware for Warps, it includes the improvements in Incurvationes and Distortiones.

### Explorator

Based on MI's Kinks and Links, they are combined in a single module.

The Kinks section is now fully polyphonic. The Links 3:1 section can optionally behave as the hardware module and average the connected voltages. All LEDs now reflect when polyphonic channels are used.

### Marmora

Based on MI's Marbles, it exposes every control and adds missing features like user defined scales; super lock; t and X reset; restores missing light animations and showing polarity in the output port LEDs.

### Anuli

Based on MI's Rings, it restores missing light animations; the "3" polyphony mode... and is completely polyphonic.

### Velamina

My attempt at recreating Veils... the 2020 version. It is polyphonic and saturates outputs beyond 10V.

## Additions

- More hardware-like LEDs for Nebulae and its descendants.

- More hardware-like LEDs for Funes.
