# Sanguine Modules Mutants

A collection based on Mutable Instruments modules and their variants.

## Modules

![alt text](pics/mutants_modules.png)

Base modules are listed in alphabetical order with their alternative firmwares immediately following.

- ### Aestus

  A modulator based on MI's Tides, it fixes PLL mode, separates it from the clock input; restores switching banks using the clock input when module is using the Sheep firmware; fixes the inverted "Mode" light colors; fixes the broken "High" and "Low" outputs, and, hopefully, fixes a long-standing crash that occurs under specific circumstances.

  - ### Temulenti

    A multifaceted modulator based based on the Parasite firmware for MI's Tides: includes every Aestus fix, additionally: restores functionality when using the clock input in Two Bumps or Two Drunks modes; Sheep model can be used.

- ### Aleae

  A polyphonic pair of Bernoulli gates based on MI's Branches. Works as described in the hardware manual. Every option is present on the face plate: no need to go context menu diving.
  
  - ### Vimina

    A dual clock divider, multiplier and swinger based on the Twigs firmware for MI's Branches.

- ### Anuli

  A completely polyphonic resonator based on MI's Rings, it restores missing light animations, and the "3" polyphony mode.

- ### Apices

  A versatile complement to any patch, based on MI's Peaks. It exposes every control and provides access to the Bouncing Ball envelope, unavailable in unmodified hardware.

  - ### Mortuus

    An all-around gap filler based on the Dead Man's Catch firmware, with some additions, for MI's Peaks.

- ### Explorator

  A completely polyphonic collection of utility modules based on MI's Kinks and Links; combined in a single module. The Links 3:1 section can optionally behave as the hardware module and average input voltages. All LEDs now reflect when polyphonic channels are used.

- ### Funes

  A powerful, polyphonic macro oscillator Based on MI's Plaits. It exposes every control and can access the 1.2 firmware modes.

  An editor for some of the new firmware modes is available! You can find it [here](https://bloodbat.github.io/Funes-Editors/)

- ### Incurvationes

  A fully polyphonic meta-modulator based on MI's Warps it has proper knob lights colors and access to the frequency shifter "Easter egg".
  
  - ### Distortiones

   A polyphonic, doctored, flexible meta-modulator based on the Parasite firmware for MI's Warps, it no longer crashes when multiple instances are used (and they don't interfere with each other...); it also includes a mode selector similar to the one used for the hardware module.
  
  - ### Mutuus

    A polyphonic, multifaceted meta-modulator based on the Symbiote firmware for MI's Warps.

- ### Marmora

  A random sampler based on MI's Marbles, it exposes every control and adds missing features like user defined scales; super lock; t and X reset; restores missing light animations and showing polarity in the output port LEDs.

- ### Mutants Blank

  Rack sleekerizer: add the Mutants goblin and a glowing Mutants logo to your rack!

- ### Nebulae

  A texture synthesizer Based on MI's Clouds and Southpole's Smoke; inspired by the Monsoon hardware variant. Exposes every control. Lights behave closer to hardware version.

  - ### Etesia

    A texture synthesizer based on the Parasite firmware for MI's Clouds and Southpole's Smoke Parasite. Exposes every control.
    
  - ### Fluctus

    A texture synthesizer based on the Kammerl Beat-Repeat firmware for MI's Clouds.

- ### Nodi

  A polyphonic, adaptable macro oscillator based on MI's Braids and Southpole's CornrowsX. Exposes every control, some unavailable in other ports.

  - ### Contextus

    A polyphonic, multipurpose macro oscillator based on the Renaissance alternative firmware for MI's Braids. Exposes every control.

- ### Velamina

  A polyphonic tetrad of voltage controlled amplifiers; my attempt at recreating MI's Veils... the 2020 version. Outputs beyond 10V are saturated.
