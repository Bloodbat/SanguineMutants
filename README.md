![alt text](pics/mutants_modules.png)

## Funes

Based on Mutable Instruments Plaits and Audible Instruments Macro Oscillator 2. It exposes every control and can access the 1.2 firmware modes.

An editor for some of the new firmware modes modes is available in this repository! You need to download it and run it locally in your browser.

## Mutants Blank

Put a goblin and the Mutants logo on your rack!

## Apices

Based on Mutable Instruments Peaks. It exposes every control and has access to the Bouncing Ball envelope, unavailable in unmodified hardware.

## Aleae

Based on Mutable Instruments Branches. Works as described in the hardware manual. Every option is present on the face plate: no need to go context menu diving.

## Nodi

Based on Mutable Instruments Braids and Southpole's CornrowsX. Exposes every control, some unavailable in other ports.

## Contextus

Based on the Renaissance alternative firmware for Braids. Exposes every control.

## Nebulae

Based on Mutable Instruments' Clouds and Southpole's Smoke; inspired by the Monsoon hardware variant. Exposes every control. Lights behave closer to hardware version.

## Etesia

Based on the Parasite firmware for Clouds and Southpole's Smoke Parasite. Exposes every control.

## Mortuus

Based on the Dead Man's Catch firmware for Peaks.

## Fluctus

Based on the Kammerl Beat-Repeat firmware for Clouds.

## Incurvationes

Based on MI's Warps it has proper knob lights colors and access to the frequency shifter "Easter egg".

## Distortiones

Based on the Parasite firmware for Warps, it no longer crashes when multiple instances are used (and they don't interfere with each other...); it also includes a mode selector similar to the one used for the hardware module.

## Mutuus

Based on the Symbiote firmware for Warps.

## Explorator

Based on MI's Kinks and Links; combined in a single module. The Kinks section is now fully polyphonic. The Links 3:1 section can optionally behave as the hardware module and average the connected voltages. All LEDs now reflect when polyphonic channels are used.
